        <p>This is the first Ca for the Front-End Development Module of Third year Students of Creative Computing (DL836).
        </p> 
        <br>
        <p>
            The breif for this Ca was to creative a website using using a front-end design development platform Vue.
        </p> 
        <br>
        <p>
            The website has to use an API called "RestCountries" and from this it will connect to the restCountries website and retreive information to power the webpages you are viewing.
        </p>  
        <br>
        <p>
            The Information on the Home page is of a Country Flag, its Name, its Offical Name and Capital. If you click on the name <b>(Highlighted Blue)</b> you will be brought to a new section of the webpage where more information of that country will be displayed. From there you can click on the map link and then you will be brought to a feed from Google Maps where you will view a map of the country.
        </p> 
        <br>
        <p>
            I hope you enjoy my effort to acheive the breif of this Ca.
